# purescript-logoot-core

This package defines the core Logoot algorithm as described in "Logoot: A
Scalable Optimistic Replication Algorithm for Collaborative Editing on P2P
Networks" by St√©phane Weiss, Pascal Urso and Pascal Molli.

Wherever possible, it tries to be polymorphic in its types.

The core identifier generation algorithm is not a direct port of the imperative
pseudocode found in the paper; it has been modified to fit a more functional
style of programming.
